In One Poker, you are initially dealt two cards.
To win a round, you must simply play a higher card than your opponent.
The only exception to this is that a 2 beats an Ace.
After each round, you maintain the card that you did not play on the previous round and you are dealt a new card as well.
Once each player has been dealt their cards, an Indicator will display information about each of your hands.
This Indicator is known as the UP/DOWN Indicator. It tells whether your opponents cards are less than 8 or 8 or more.
For instance, if you receive a 7 and an 8, the Indicator will tell your opponent you have drawn UP DOWN.
That's all you need to know. Enjoy!
